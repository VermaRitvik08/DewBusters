**Problem Statement**

The presence of dew on sports fields is a pressing issue, posing risks to athlete safety and pitch quality. Stagnant dew heightens the likelihood of athlete injuries and encourages fungal growth, undermining the turf's condition. These challenges are amplified during the off-season due to the absence of natural dew dispersion from regular play. Current dew dispersal methods for now are manual labour and/or use of heavy machinery that are dependent on investment by the groundowners

**Our Solution**

Addressing the challenge of dew accumulation on athletic fields, our solution introduces a dual-rover system operating autonomously to clear dew with minimal manual intervention. This approach not only promises a reduction in labor but also aligns with cost-effective field maintenance. The rovers are designed to thoroughly cover the required area, mitigating human error and ensuring consistent ground coverage, making the dew dispersal process efficient.
